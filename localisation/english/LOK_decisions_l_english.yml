The disintegration of the Kaiser's mighty Katzenartig Imperium has left the ancestral Katzen homeland fractured and divided amongst warlords vying for power and survival. But, all is not lost for the Katzen species. Although the situation looks dire now, time is famously known to heal all wounds, and a new power may perhaps emerge out of the ashes and one day reunite the Herzlands under an united government... or not.\n\nGiven our shared heritage, we will automatically §Gcore§! any Herzlands state that reaches §Y80%§! compliance. Various focuses, decisions and formables may §Glower§! this threshold, facilitating our conquests.\n\nWe currently control §Y[?ROOT.current_herzlands_state_count]§! out of §Y[?global.herzlands_states_array^num]§!
