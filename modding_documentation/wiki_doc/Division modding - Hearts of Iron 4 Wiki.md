_This article is for creating divisions as part of a country's military. For sub-units making up the construction of division templates, see [Unit modding](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Unit_modding "Unit modding")._

Units are the foundations of Hearts of Iron, and can be broken down into air wings, divisions and naval task forces. The definitions are located within /Hearts of Iron IV/history/units/\*.txt files and can be loaded by using the [load\_oob effect](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Effect#load_oob "Effect") or [various attributes inside of country history](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Country_creation#Order_of_battle "Country creation"). The filename is irrelevant for interpretation, but it must match up with the effect or the attribute used to load it.

The game uses orders of battle to define the state of the country's military. Traditionally, the starting equipment production is defined in them, using an [effect](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Effect "Effect") block. Optionally, the current focus progress may be included.  
**Each order of battle must be loaded in order for the units to show up.** For the starting state of the country's military, [this is done in country history](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Country_creation#Order_of_battle "Country creation"). [The load\_oob effect](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Effect#load_oob "Effect") can be used to load one mid-game, which will add the information in the order of battle to the current information of the country, creating division templates and units and executing the effects.

The internal names for sub-units can be found in /Hearts of Iron IV/common/units/\*.txt files, [localisation can be checked as well](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Modding#Searching_multiple_files "Modding").

## Land units\[[edit](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Division_modding&veaction=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Land units") | [edit source](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Division_modding&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Land units")\]

The land unit order of battle is usually the one that's loaded with `oob` or `set_oob` in country history. Most commonly, one is used since most definitions don't differ by DLC. However, if tank equipment types are referenced, such as when a unit is forced to use a certain tank equipment type or starting equipment production includes tanks, this is split into 2 files divided by the [![No Step Back](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/images/thumb/7/7d/DLC_No_Step_Back.png/22px-DLC_No_Step_Back.png)](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/No_Step_Back "No Step Back")[No Step Back](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/No_Step_Back "No Step Back") DLC, with an if statement in the place that loads it deciding whether one should be loaded, such as the following in a country history file:

```
if = {
    limit = { has_dlc = "No Step Back" }
    set_oob = "TAG_1936_nsb"
    else = { set_oob = "TAG_1936_legacy" }
}
```

### Division template\[[edit](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Division_modding&veaction=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Division template") | [edit source](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Division_modding&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Division template")\]

Land units require a template of some sort, which assigns the necessary information. The template definition is equivalent to the `division_template` effect internally. A simple template can be defined as such:

```
division_template = {
    name = "Blueskirt Division"
    regiments = {
        infantry = { x = 0 y = 0 }
        infantry = { x = 0 y = 1 }
        artillery_brigade = { x = 1 y = 0 }
        artillery_brigade = { x = 1 y = 1 }
    }
    support = {
        artillery = { x = 0 y = 0 }
    }
}
```

-   `name = ""` is the name of the division template as it shows up in the template selection. This will also get used for creating or modifying units.
-   `regiments = { ... }` and `support = { ... }` decide the sub-units of the template, meaning [combat battalions](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Division#Combat_Battalions "Division") and [support companies](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Division#Support_companies "Division") respectively. In particular:
    -   `subunit = { x = 0 y = 0 }` decides the placement of the specified sub-unit. The coordinates represent the [Cartesian coordinate system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "wp:Cartesian coordinate system"), where (0,0) is the top-left corner, x goes left-to-right, and y goes up-to-down. For a unit to be placed as a support company, it must have `group = support` in its definition, and to be placed in combat battalions, it must have a different group. The group cannot change in a single y column.

By default, the combat battalions have 5 columns and 5 rows, while the support companies have 1 column and 5 rows.<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Division_modding#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> The max index is one less than the total amount.

There are also optional arguments:

-   `division_names_group = USA_INF_01` forcefully changes the name group used for new divisions, defined in /Hearts of Iron IV/common/units/names\_divisions/\*.txt files. This is used to automatically generate names and numeration for new divisions, such as a division newly created by the player being named "1st 'Big Red One' Division". If not set, the template automatically picks the name group based on the sub-units.
-   `is_locked = yes` will make the division locked, preventing the player from changing any of its information and creating/deleting/editing units with it. Defaults to no if unset.
-   `force_allow_recruiting = yes` will allow recruiting new divisions from the template even if it locked. Has no effect on non-locked templates. Default to no if unset.
-   `division_cap = 12` is the maximum amount of divisions that may be recruited with this template. The template has to be locked. Defaults to no cap if unset.
-   `priority = 0` is the supply receiving priority. The options are 0 for "Reserves", 1 for default, and 2 for "Elite". Default to 1 if unset.
-   `template_counter = 10` is used to override the default icon used for the position. The particular example with 10 will make sure that the sprites with the name of `GFX_div_templ_10_large` and `GFX_div_templ_10_small` will get used.
-   `override_model = GER_infantry_entity` is used to change the [entity](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Entity_modding "Entity modding") that is used by divisions made from this template. Defaults to automatically determining based on the sub-units if unset.

### Division placement\[[edit](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Division_modding&veaction=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Division placement") | [edit source](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Division_modding&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Division placement")\]

The `units = { ... }` block is used for positioning land and naval divisions. In particular, a land division placement is done via `division = { ... }`:

```
units = {
    division= {
        name = "1st Blueskirt Division"
        location = 9392 # Edinburgh
        division_template = "Blueskirt Division"
        start_experience_factor = 0.2
        start_equipment_factor = 0.3
    }
    division= {
        division_name = {
            is_name_ordered = yes
            name_order = 35
        }
        location = 6488
        division_template = "Infanterie-Division"
        force_equipment_variants = { infantry_equipment_0 = { owner = "SCO" } }
        officer = {
            name = SCO_officer_1
            portraits = {
                army = {
                    large = GFX_SCO_officer_1
                    small = GFX_SCO_officer_generic_small
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

For the division naming, there are two mutually-exclusive ways to do so:

-   `name = "Unit's name"` directly changes the name of the division to the given string.
-   `division_name = { ... }` instead uses the name group assigned to the division template:
    -   `is_name_ordered = yes` is mandatory to include.
    -   `name_order = 35` sets the number that gets used for the numeration. If the name group's `ordered = { ... }` includes this number, that entry gets used. Otherwise, the `fallback_name` is used.

There are these mandatory arguments in addition to the name:

-   `location = 1234` is the province where the unit should be positioned.
-   `division_template` is the name of the template that the unit should use. Generally best to limit to the one that's defined in the same file.

There are also optional arguments:

-   `start_experience_factor = 0.2` sets the experience level of the division (from Greens to Veterans) in the range from 0 to 1. If unset, defaults to 0. The experience level boundaries in the base game are `{ 0.1, 0.3, 0.75, 0.9 }`.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Division_modding#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>
-   `start_equipment_factor = 0.5` decides the starting equipment level of the division, not deciding on the manpower. The equipment is not subtracted from the reserves of the country. If unset, defaults to 1.
-   `start_manpower_factor = 0.3` decides the starting manpower level of the division. If unset, then it's automatically subtracted from the reserves of the country until the highest possible level.
-   `force_equipment_variants = { ... }` is a set of equipment types that the division should use, replacing the default. Each entry in there is `equipment_type = { ... }`, which may include:
    -   `owner = TAG` is the owner of the equipment that should be used. This should be the same as the country which gets the order of battle.
    -   `creator = TAG` is the original creator of the equipment that should be used. This is used to determine the variants, and it defaults to the owner if not specified.
    -   `amount = 14` is how much of the equipment should be there. The rest of required equipment within the archetype will remain ungiven.
    -   `version_name = "Variant's name"` is the name of the equipment variant that should be used. If the equipment type requires a variant to use, such as tanks in [![No Step Back](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/images/thumb/7/7d/DLC_No_Step_Back.png/22px-DLC_No_Step_Back.png)](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/No_Step_Back "No Step Back")[No Step Back](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/No_Step_Back "No Step Back"), this is mandatory. Otherwise, this is optional.
-   `officer = { ... }` is a [character definition](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Character_modding "Character modding") that will be used for the divisional commander if promoted to a commander or the [officer corps](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Officer_corps "Officer corps") system is used. In particular, these attributes are common inside:
    -   `name = loc_key` is the [localisation](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Localisation "Localisation") key to be used as the division commander's name.
    -   `portraits = { army = { large = "GFX_portrait_SCO_character" small = "GFX_idea_SCO_character" } }` is the portrait that the division commander must use. The large portrait will be used for the corps commander promotion and the small portrait will be used for the officer corps system. If both are unset, [randomly generates a portrait](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Country_creation#Character_portraits "Country creation"). If the large is set, the small portrait will default to the name of large portrait with \_small appended to the end.

## Equipment production\[[edit](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Division_modding&veaction=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Equipment production") | [edit source](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Division_modding&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Equipment production")\]

The equipment production is simulated using the `instant_effect = { ... }` block. This is a regular [effect](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Effect "Effect") block, any effect can be used here. Usually, the production is added in this manner:

```
instant_effect = {
    add_equipment_production = {
        equipment = {
    type = infantry_equipment_0
    creator = "ARG"
}
requested_factories = 1
progress = 0.19
efficiency = 100
    }
}

```

The `add_equipment_production = { ... }` has these attributes:

-   `equipment = { ... }` decides on which equipment specifically should be made, in particular:
-   `requested_factories = 1` is the amount of military factories or dockyards that should be dedicated towards producing this equipment type. If unfulfilled, the factories will be assigned into the queue.
-   `progress = 0.2` is used to assign the current amount of progress towards a single piece of equipment being finished. This is usually changed for expensive equipment, such as battleships.
-   `efficiency = 100` is, with 0 as 0% and 100 as 100%, the [production efficiency](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Production_efficiency "Production efficiency") which the factories should have immediately.

## Adding Air Wings\[[edit](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Division_modding&veaction=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Adding Air Wings") | [edit source](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Division_modding&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Adding Air Wings")\]

```
air_wings = {
    500 = {
        fighter_equipment_0 = {
            owner = "BRA"
            amount = 10
        }
    }
}

```

-   **Air Wings** is the command that creates the air wing.
-   **500** is the state where the air wing spawns. The state should have an air base set there.
-   **fighter\_equipment\_0** is the type of aircraft that is in the air wing.
-   **Owner** is who created the type of aircraft. Does not need to be the country you are making the file for.
-   **Amount** is how many of that type of equipment is in that air wing.

## Adding Navies\[[edit](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Division_modding&veaction=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Adding Navies") | [edit source](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Division_modding&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Adding Navies")\]

                }
            }
        }

            ship = {
                name = "NRB Humayta" # Name 2
                definition = submarine

                        amount = 1
                        owner = BRA
                        version_name = "Humayta Class"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

```

-   **Fleet** begins a new fleet which can comprise of multiple task forces.
-   **Name 1** is the name of the fleet.
-   **Naval Base** is the location of where the fleet is headquartered.
-   **Name 2** is the name of the task force.
-   **Location** is where the task force spawns.
-   **Ship** creates a new ship within the task force.
-   **Pride Of The Fleet** designates a ship as the pride of the fleet. Only one ship can be the Pride Of The Fleet at a time. Optional.
-   **Definition** sets what type of ship it is.
-   **Equipment** sets what level of equipment the ship uses.
-   **Amount** is how much of that equipment the ship uses. Should be kept at one.
-   **Owner** is who created the equipment the ship uses and who receives it.
-   **Creator** is who will create the ship if the owner has not unlocked the technology. Optional.
-   **Version Name** is for custom classes of ship. Optional

Note: The owner or creator country needs to have the technology unlocked and the version needs to exist in their countries history file.

### Non-Man The Guns\[[edit](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Division_modding&veaction=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Non-Man The Guns") | [edit source](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Division_modding&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Non-Man The Guns")\]

The only main difference between this section and the Man The Guns section is the equipment.

        name = "Armada Argentina"
        naval_base = 12364
        task_force = {
