## Equipment\[[edit](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Equipment_modding&veaction=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Equipment") | [edit source](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Equipment_modding&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Equipment")\]

Equipment is found in /Hearts of Iron IV/common/units/equipment/\*.txt. Equipment is split into two types, archetype and regular. Archetype equipment is used to assign more general attributes that regular equipment then inherits via the _archetype_ attribute.

Archetype equipment follows the following format:

```
equipments = {
<equipment> = {
year = <int># Limits the equipment from appearing before the specified year. Optional
picture = <name># GFX reference used to define equipment picture in lend-lease

can_be_produced = {# Optional, specifies when equipment of this category can be produced.
<triggers>
}

is_archetype = yes# Specifies an entry as an archetype entry. All non-archetype entries inherit 
is_buildable = no# Prevents this equipment from being built.
active = yes# Determines if this equipment is available without unlocking from a technology.

type = <type>   # Internal type: what kind of unit can use this equipment

group_by = <group>  # How the equipment is grouped in the production screen
interface_category = <type> # Which category the equipment appears in the production screen

# Resources used to build this equipment
resources = {
<resource> = <amount>
}

# Modifiers the equipment uses
<modifiers> 
}
}
```

Regular equipment follows the following format:

```
equipments = {
    <equipment> = {
        year = <int>        # Limits the equipment from appearing before the specified year. Optional
        
        active = yes            # Determines if this equipment is available without unlocking from a technology.
        
        archetype = <equipment> # Which archetype equipment this equipment inherits from.
        parent = <equipment>    # Which equipment is parent to this equipment (i.e. which does it supercede)
        priority = <int>        # Priority for usage over other equipment.
        visual_level = <int>    # Image priority in production screen
        
        # Resources used to build this equipment
        resources = {
            <resource> = <amount>
        }
        
        # Modifiers the equipment uses
        <modifiers> 
    }
}

```

## Stats\[[edit](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Equipment_modding&veaction=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Stats") | [edit source](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Equipment_modding&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Stats")\]

Equipment uses modifiers to determine which stats it confers to its assigned unit.

Typically an equipment will include the following:

```
build_cost_ic = <float>
lend_lease_cost = <float>
reliability = <float>
maximum_speed = <float>
defense = <float>
breakthrough = <float>
hardness = <float>
armor_value = <float>
soft_attack = <float>
hard_attack = <float>
ap_attack = <float>
air_attack = <float>

```

Note that the default _maximum\_speed_ is 4, so you don't need to include it when you want equipment to confer the default _maximum\_speed_.

## Modifiers\[[edit](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Equipment_modding&veaction=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Modifiers") | [edit source](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Equipment_modding&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Modifiers")\]

The following list is all the valid modifiers for use in equipment (and units):

```
lend_lease_cost = 1             # Space taken up in convoy
build_cost_ic = 0.4             # Production Cost - How much factory output this piece of equipment needs
manpower = 300                  # Manpower - Cost in manpower to produce

## Localization\[[edit](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Equipment_modding&veaction=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Localization") | [edit source](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Equipment_modding&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Localization")\]

Each equipment must be localized in a _.yml_ file in the _localisation_ folder within your mod.

```
<equipment>: ""
<equipment>_desc: ""
<equipment>_short: ""

```

For country-specific localization, prefix with the tag:

```
<tag>_<equipment>: ""
<tag>_<equipment>_desc: ""
<tag>_<equipment>_short: ""

```
