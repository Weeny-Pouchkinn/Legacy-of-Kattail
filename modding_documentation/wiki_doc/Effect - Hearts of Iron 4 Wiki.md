Effects (also known as Commands) are used in order to affect the game dynamically from within a specific scope. They are a one-time change to the current condition of the game, **without the ability to have a lasting effect**. Instead, [modifiers](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Modifiers "Modifiers") are used to have a continuous, everlasting effect on the game's condition that can be represented with a number. Effect blocks cannot be used to apply modifiers directly, however they can add something that can apply modifiers, most commonly with [add\_ideas](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Effect#add_ideas).

Effects are used throughout the game in numerous scopes, most commonly edited effect blocks are [national focus rewards](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/National_focus_modding "National focus modding"), [event options](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Event_modding "Event modding") and [decision effects](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Decision_modding "Decision modding").

Note that certain effects may take a value from a variable, i.e. `add_manpower = var:my_var` This is noted by **<variable>** in an effect's parameters. See [Variables](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Variables "Variables") for information on the variable effects.

The list of effects may be outdated. A complete, but unsorted, list of effects can be found in /Hearts of Iron IV/documentation/effects\_documentation.html or /Hearts of Iron IV/documentation/effects\_documentation.md.

## Scopes\[[edit](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Effect&veaction=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Scopes") | [edit source](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Effect&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Scopes")\]

Scopes serve as special effect types that modify the entity that serves as the context for the effects being executed, such as `GER = { add_political_power = 150 }` adding 150 political power to [![Flag of Germany](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/images/thumb/e/e9/German_Reich.png/24px-German_Reich.png)](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Germany "Germany") [Germany](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Germany "Germany").

### Effect scopes\[[edit](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Effect&veaction=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Effect scopes") | [edit source](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Effect&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Effect scopes")\]

These can only be used as [effects](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Effects "Effects"); trying to use them as [triggers](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Triggers "Triggers") will result in nothing happening.

### Effects with scopes\[[edit](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Scopes&veaction=edit&section=T-1 "Edit section: Effects with scopes") | [edit source](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Scopes&action=edit&section=T-1 "Edit section: Effects with scopes")\]

Effects that change the scope include the following:

-   [start\_civil\_war](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Effect#start_civil_war "Effect"), which changes it to the rebelling dynamic country.
-   [create\_dynamic\_country](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Effect#create_dynamic_country "Effect"), which changes it to the newly-created dynamic country.

### Dual scopes\[[edit](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Effect&veaction=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Dual scopes") | [edit source](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Effect&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Dual scopes")\]

The following scopes can be used either as effect or trigger scopes; some can also be used as the right side of some effects and triggers as a target. If usage as a target is possible, it's marked within the table.

Several dual scopes may have a scope that varies depending on where it's used, such as variables, which can be set to anything.

Dual scopes:  
Collapse
| Name | Usage | Target type | Example | Description | Usable as target | Version Added |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TAG | Always usable | Country scope | `SOV = { country_event = my_event.1 }` | The country defined by the tag or tag alias. Tag aliases are defined in /Hearts of Iron IV/common/country\_tag\_aliases, as a way to refer to a specific country (such as a side in a civil war) in addition to its actual tag. If the country with the exact tag doesn't exist, but a dynamic country originating from the specified tag does, the scope will refer to the dynamic country. | ✓ | 1.0 |
| <state\_id> | Always usable | State scope | `123 = { transfer_state_to = SCO }` | The state defined by this id. | ✓ | 1.0 |
| <character> | not within Character scope | Character scope | `ENG_theodore_makhno = { set_nationality = UKR }` | On game versions prior to 1.12.8, the character must be already recruited by the country this is scoped from. | ✓ | 1.11 |
| mio:<MIO> | Within country scope only | MIO scope | `mio:AST_cockatoo_doe_organization = { … }` | The MIO identified by that ID as defined within the /Hearts of Iron IV/common/military\_industrial\_organization/organizations/\*.txt file. | ✓ | 1.13 |
| sp:<special\_project> | Within country scope only | Special project scope | `sp:sp_land_flamethrower_tank = { … }` | The special project identified by that ID as defined within the /Hearts of Iron IV/common/special\_projects/projects/\*.txt file. | ✓ | 1.15 |
| ROOT | Always usable | Depends on usage | 
```
ENG = {
    FRA = {
        GER = {
            declare_war_on = {
                target = ROOT
                type = annex_everything
            }
        }
    }
} #GER declares war on ENG (if there is no scope before ENG)

```

 | Targets the root node of the block, an inherent property of each block. Most commonly, this is the default scope: for example, ROOT [within a national focus](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/National_focus_modding "National focus modding") will always refer to the country doing the focus and ROOT [within a event](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Event_modding "Event modding") will always refer to the country getting the event. However, some blocks do distinguish between the default scope and ROOT, such as [certain scripted GUI contexts](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Scripted_GUI_modding "Scripted GUI modding") or [certain on actions](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/On_actions#La_R.C3.A9sistance "On actions"). If a block doesn't have ROOT defined (such as [on\_startup in on actions](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/On_actions#on_startup "On actions")), then it is impossible to use it. | ✓ | 1.0 |
| THIS | Always usable | Depends on usage | 

```
set_temp_variable = { target_country = THIS }
```

 | Targets the current scope where it's used. For example, when used in [every\_state](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Effect#every_state), it will refer to the state that's currently being evaluated. Primarily useful for [variables](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Variables "Variables") (as in the example, where omitting it wouldn't work) or for [built-in localisation commands](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Localisation#Namespaces "Localisation"), where some scope must be specified. More rarely, this may help with scope manipulation when using [PREV](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Effect#PREV). Since omitting it makes no difference in how the code gets interpreted, there is little to no usage outside of these cases. | ✓ | 1.0 |
| PREV | Always usable | Depends on usage | 

```
FRA = {
    random_country = {
        GER = {
            declare_war_on = {
                target = PREV
                type = annex_everything
            }
        }
    }
} #Germany declares war on random_country

```

 | Targets the scope that the current scope is contained in. Can have additional applications where the assumed default scope differs from the ROOT, such as in state events or some on\_actions. Can be chained indefinitely as PREV.PREV. **Commonly results in broken-looking tooltips**: what's shown to the player doesn't always correlate with reality.

See also: [PREV usage](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Scopes#PREV_usage "Scopes").

 | ✓ | 1.0 |
| FROM | Always usable | Depends on usage | 

```
declare_war_on = {
    target = FROM
    type = annex_everything
}

FROM = {
    load_oob = defend_ourselves
}

```

 | Can be chained indefinitely as FROM.FROM. Used to target various hardcoded scopes inherent to the block, often a secondary scope in addition to ROOT. For example:

In [events](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Event_modding "Event modding"), this refers to the country that sent the event (i.e. if the event was fired [using an effect](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Event_modding#Effect "Event modding"), then it's the ROOT scope where it was fired).  
In [targeted decisions](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Decision_modding#targeted_decisions "Decision modding") or [diplomacy scripted triggers](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Conditions#Scripted_triggers "Conditions"), this refers to the scope that is targeted.

| owner | Within state, character, or combatant scope only | Country scope | `owner = { add_ideas = owns_this_state }` | In state scope, the country that owns the state. In combatant scope, the country that owns the divisions. In character scope, the country that has recruited the character. [Subject to the 'invalid event target' error](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Scopes#Invalid_event_target "Scopes") when used for a state. | X | 1.0 |

| capital\_scope | Within country scope only | State scope | `capital_scope = { … }` | The state where the capital of the current country is located in. [Subject to the 'invalid event target' error](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Scopes#Invalid_event_target "Scopes") in rare cases. | X | 1.0 |
| event\_target:<event\_target\_key> | Always usable | Depends on usage | `event_target:my_event_target = { … }` | Saved [event target or global event target](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Data_structures#Event_targets "Data structures"), with no space after the colon. [Subject to the 'invalid event target' error.](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Scopes#Invalid_event_target "Scopes") | ✓ | 1.0 |
| var:<variable> | Always usable | Depends on usage | `var:my_variable = { … }`  
`add_to_faction = my_variable` or  
`add_to_faction = var:my_variable` | [Variable](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Variable "Variable") set to a scope.

When used as a target rather than a scope, the `var:` can be omitted in most cases.

    copy_tag = SOV
    add_political_power = 100
    transfer_state = 123
}

```

 | Creates a new dynamic country, akin to ones used in civil wars. | The [reserve\_dynamic\_country](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Effect#reserve_dynamic_country) effect can be used if the dynamic country does not yet exist in order to ensure that it does not get overwritten by other creations of dynamic countries. If this is not done, the dynamic country will immediately stop existing if no states are transferred in the same scope.

Every state of the original country immediately gets set as a dynamic country's core: if that's unneeded, the cores would need to be removed after creation.

 | Starts a civil war for the current scope with the specified parameters. | `states = all` would include every single state controlled by the country. **If the country's current capital state is set as one of the states that the revolt can gain, it won't fire**. [set\_capital](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Effect#set_capital) can be used to change the capital beforehand, with [on\_civil\_war\_end](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/On_actions#on_civil_war_end "On actions") being used to set it back to the default after the civil war ends.

Elections will always be disallowed for the breakaway. If the `ruling_party` attribute is used, the original country will have its elections disallowed. In the base game files, an [on action](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/On_action "On action") is set up to ensure that elections get allowed if the democratic side wins the civil war.

A civil war started via this effect cannot have more than two sides and the effect cannot be used in [history](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Country_creation#Country_history "Country creation") or [bookmark's effect = { ... }](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Bookmark_modding "Bookmark modding"). For adding more sides or starting one before the game's start, this can be simulated by setting an existing war (typically originating from a dynamic country created via [create\_dynamic\_country](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Effect#create_dynamic_country)) as a civil war via [add\_civil\_war\_target](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Effect#add_civil_war_target).

| remove\_civil\_war\_target | `<country>` - The country to set as the target. | 

```
remove_civil_war_target = TAG
```

 | Removes the status of the war as a civil war between the pair of countries. | The ongoing war must already be marked as a civil war, whether it was initiated by [start\_civil\_war](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Effect#start_civil_war) or [add\_civil\_war\_target](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Effect#add_civil_war_target) was used to mark it as one. | 1.12.13 |

These scopes are used within effect scopes to control the execution of effects.

### If statements\[[edit](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Effect&veaction=edit&section=60 "Edit section: If statements") | [edit source](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Effect&action=edit&section=60 "Edit section: If statements")\]

An [if statement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_(computer_programming)#If%E2%80%93then(%E2%80%93else) "wp:Conditional (computer programming)") allows an execution of effects to only be done if certain [triggers](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Triggers "Triggers") are met. Conditional statements are represented with the `if = { ... }` effect. `limit = { ... }` inside of the if statement serves as a [trigger block](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Triggers "Triggers") that defines the conditions when it should be executed, and everything else directly inside of `if = { ... }` is interpreted as the effects that should be executed if the condition is true.

For example, the following will add 10% [![Stability](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/images/thumb/a/ae/Stability.png/22px-Stability.png)](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Stability "Stability")[Stability](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Stability "Stability") to the country this is executed on if it has positive [![Political Power](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/images/thumb/2/24/Political_power.png/22px-Political_power.png)](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Government#Political_power "Political Power")[Political Power](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Government#Political_power "Government") and below 90% stability:

```
if = {
    limit = {
        has_political_power > 0
        stability < 0.9
    }
    add_stability = 0.1
}
```

If the limit is not met, then none of the effects inside will be executed. If it is, then each one will be. If the limit is omitted, it defaults to being always true.

**The effects must be inside of the if statement to be tied to the limit**. For example, this will always give 100 [![Political Power](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/images/thumb/2/24/Political_power.png/22px-Political_power.png)](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Government#Political_power "Political Power")[Political Power](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Government#Political_power "Government"), regardless of what country is played:

```
if = {
    limit = { tag = BHR }
}                         # Closes if = { ... }. Since no effects are inside, this means that the if statement does absolutely nothing
add_political_power = 100 # Outside of if = { ... }, so it will always give 100 political power, even if not playing as BHR
```

Optionally, `else_if = { ... }` (with `limit = { ... }` serving in a similar fashion) and `else = { ... }` can be added. If the initial limit within `if = { ... }` is false, it moves on to the next `else_if = { ... }`, checking the limit there. If the limit there is false, then it moves on to the next one, until hitting an end or an `else = { ... }`.  
Two variants exist: nested and unnested. In the first case, the `else_if` or `else` is put directly inside of the preceding `if` or `else_if`, while in the second case it's put _right after_. In case of overlap, unnested if statements are preferred. Here is an example using unnested if statements:

```
if = {
    limit = {
        stability < 0.3 # If stability is below 30%, add 30%.
    }
    add_stability = 0.3
}
else_if = {
    limit = {
        stability < 0.6 # Otherwise, if it's below 60% (i.e. 30-59%), add 20%
    }
    add_stability = 0.2
}
else = {
    add_stability = 0.1 # If there's 60-100% stability, add 10%
}

```

Within the tooltip, only effects that would be executed are shown. The effects within an unfulfilled if statement (or an `else`/`else_if` that's not read due to the if statement being met) will be hidden from the player, and so will the trigger. In order to avoid player confusion, [custom effect tooltips can be used to tell the player what this effect block would do](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Effect#Effect_tooltips), such as being used within an `else`.

### Random effects\[[edit](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Effect&veaction=edit&section=61 "Edit section: Random effects") | [edit source](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Effect&action=edit&section=61 "Edit section: Random effects")\]

If you want an effect to have a random chance to be done or have nothing happen otherwise, the `random = { ... }` block is the simplest way to accomplish that:

```
random = {
    chance = 80
    add_stability = 0.4
    add_war_support = 0.3
}
```

This in particular will have an 80% chance to add 40% stability and 30% war support and, accordingly, a 20% chance to do nothing. The chance here is on the scale from 0 to 100.

If you want the game to choose between effect blocks, random\_list can be used instead. For example, if you wanted an effect to randomly given the player one out of four bonuses, you'd do the following:

```
random_list = {
    10 = {
        add_stability = 0.5
    }
    10 = {
        add_manpower = 10000
    }
    10 = {
        add_war_support = 0.5
    }
    10 = {
        army_experience = 100
    }
}

```

The number is not the chance, but the weight for each option, as they don't have to add up to 100 or any number. An option with the weight of 20 is twice as likely to be picked as the option with the chance of 10, for instance. In total, the probability for an option to be picked is equal to the weight of the option divided by the sum of all weights.

It is also possible to use modifiers (akin to [MTTH blocks](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/MTTH "MTTH")) to affect the weight of each possible random effect or to use [variables](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Variables "Variables") as chances.

```
random_list = {
    30 = {
        modifier = {
            factor = 1.3
            has_country_flag = inward_perfect_flag
        }
        add_stability = 0.5
    }
    25 = {
        add_manpower = 10000
    }
    20 = {
        add_war_support = 0.5
    }
    my_variable = { # Taking "my_variable" as the variable's name, both "var:my_variable" and "my_variable" are valid options, left up to the developer's preference.
        army_experience = 100
    }
}

```

If the country flag inward\_perfect\_flag is set, it'll multiply the above chance of 30 by 1.3 to get 39. Meanwhile, `my_variable` will take the value of the according temp variable or the current scope's variable as the weight of the option.

Note that if you want to create a repeatable decision including a random list, by default the same decision will pick the same random result every time it is triggered in a game. You can reverse this behaviour by including the following line in the decision block:

```
fixed_random_seed = no

```

**This is only for decisions**. Elsewhere, random seed is unfixed by default, making this argument unnecessary to set to "no".  

### Tooltip manipulation\[[edit](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Effect&veaction=edit&section=62 "Edit section: Tooltip manipulation") | [edit source](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Effect&action=edit&section=62 "Edit section: Tooltip manipulation")\]

The "tooltip" in this case refers to the text shown to the player in-game that explains what the effect block changes within the game, such as "**+50** [![Political Power](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/images/thumb/2/24/Political_power.png/22px-Political_power.png)](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Government#Political_power "Political Power")[Political Power](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Government#Political_power "Government")".

There are 3 ways to edit the tooltip within an effect block:

-   `hidden_effect = { ... }` is used in order to hide the effects within from the tooltip, making their execution not get shown to the player.
-   `effect_tooltip = { ... }` is, instead, used in order to put the effects into the tooltip without actually executing them.
-   `custom_effect_tooltip = my_localisation_key` is used in order to put an arbitrary paragraph of text as an effect that will get executed.

For example, this sample [focus' completion reward](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/National_focus_modding "National focus modding") utilises all three:

```
completion_reward = { 
    hidden_effect = {
        every_subject_country = { country_event = my_event.1 }
    }
    custom_effect_tooltip = send_event_to_subjects_tt
    effect_tooltip = {
        add_political_power = 100
    }
    custom_effect_tooltip = reject_war_tt
}
```

In this case, send\_event\_to\_subjects\_tt and reject\_war\_tt are localisation keys defined within any /Hearts of Iron IV/localisation/english/\*\_l\_english.yml file encoded with UTF-8-BOM, assuming the English language.

```
 send_event_to_subjects_tt: "Sends a demand to our every subject.\nIf they agree, we get the following for each subject:"
 reject_war_tt: "If they reject the demand, we gain a wargoal against them."

```

In-game, this will appear as such:

Effect:

Sends a demand to our every subject.  
If they agree, we get the following for each subject:  
Political Power: **+100**  
If they reject the demand, we gain a wargoal against them.

Noticably, the effect that fires the country event gets hidden from the tooltip. After completing the focus, the only thing that happens is that every subject country receives an event with the ID of `my_event.1`, the country does not immediately gain 100 political power.

## Meta effects\[[edit](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Effect&veaction=edit&section=63 "Edit section: Meta effects") | [edit source](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Effect&action=edit&section=63 "Edit section: Meta effects")\]

Meta effects allow you to use non-dynamic effects (the ones that do not accept modifiers and can only use static tokens or constant values) as if they were accepting variables.

```
add_equipment_to_stockpile = {
    type = infantry_equipment_2
    amount = eq_amount
}

```

In the effect shown above, amount of equipment added is dynamic and can be set using the variable "eq\_amount". However, this effect does not let you use a variable as equipment type. You can not store "infantry\_equipment\_2" in a variable and use it here.

However, meta effects will let you use variables and scripted localization within them to build effects as if they were texts and run them. Let's make previous effect accept equipment type and equipment level as variables stored in "eq\_type" and "eq\_level".

```
set_variable = { eq_type = 1 } # Sets the equipment type to "1", which determines the equipment given using scripted localisation, included below
set_variable = { eq_amount = 10 } # Sets the amount of equipment given to 10
set_variable = { eq_level = 2 } # Sets the equipment level to 2, which is used directly in the meta effect, no scripted localisation required

meta_effect = { # The actual meta effect. This can go anywhere you need it: in a decision, in a scripted effect, in a scripted GUI click effect, etc...
    text = {
        add_equipment_to_stockpile = {
            type = [EQ_TYPE]_[EQ_LEVEL]
            amount = eq_amount
        }
    }
    EQ_LEVEL = "[?eq_level|.0]" # Gets the "eq_level" variable and saves it as "EQ_LEVEL" for the meta effect to use
    EQ_TYPE = "[This.GetEquipmentName]" # Gets the equipment type from scripted localisation, included below, based on the "eq_type" variable, and saves it as "EQ_TYPE" for the meta effect to use
}

```

```
# The scripted localization for the "eq_type" variable, which goes in a scripted localisation file
defined_text = { # Since the "eq_type" variable in this example is equal to 1, the equipment given by the effect is "artillery_equipment"
    name = GetEquipmentName
    text = {
        trigger = {
            check_variable = { eq_type = 0 }
        }
        localization_key = "infantry_equipment"
    }
    text = {
        trigger = {
            check_variable = { eq_type = 1 }
        }
        localization_key = "artillery_equipment"
    }
}

```

As you can see, we have created a meta\_effect that takes two arguments. These arguments will be used replacing the parameters \[EQ\_TYPE\] and \[EQ\_LEVEL\] inside the meta effect. EQ\_LEVEL will be replaced by \[?eq\_level|.0\] which is the integer value of eq\_level (in this case 2.000 becomes 2). EQ\_TYPE is a bit more complicated, it is being replaced by a scripted localization. This scripted localization will check eq\_type variable and depending on its value it will return the key token for the equipment. If it is 0, it will return "infantry\_equipment". If it is 1, it will return "artillery\_equipment".

So the final result is \[EQ\_TYPE\] is being replaced by "artillery\_equipment" and \[EQ\_LEVEL\] is being replaced by "2" and in the end our effect will be built as:

```
add_equipment_to_stockpile = {
    type = artillery_equipment_2
    amount = eq_amount
}

```

which will give you 10 artillery\_equipment\_2.

debug = yes can be added to meta effects. Which will print the final effect to game.log when the effect is executed and make debugging easier.

## Scripted effects\[[edit](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Effect&veaction=edit&section=64 "Edit section: Scripted effects") | [edit source](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Effect&action=edit&section=64 "Edit section: Scripted effects")\]

Scripted effects serve a similar purpose to [functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine) in that they can be defined in /Hearts of Iron IV/common/scripted\_effects/\*.txt and then used elsewhere as a shortened version. **A scripted effect will never run by itself** and requires being used as an effect elsewhere to be executed. Alongside that, the game allows the creation of custom console commands, which are scripted effects.

A scripted effect is defined simply as

```
scripted_effect_name = {
<effects>
}
```

This example can be used as an effect in regular code as `scripted_effect_name = yes`.

Scripted effects can be accessed in console by typing `e scripted_effect_name` to run them.

To create a custom console command, the scripted effect's name should begin with `d_`. The console command itself does not include `d_`, so `d_test_command` would be run in console as `test_command`  
In custom console commands, the country running the command is FROM, while ROOT is the selected country, state, or character. Anything entered after the console command, separated by spaces like `test_command 123 321 GER` is added to the 'args' temp [array](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Arrays "Arrays"). An example of a scripted effect which will transfer every state entered as an argument to the country that runs the console command is

```
d_transfer_states = {
for_each_scope_loop = {
array = args
FROM = {
transfer_state = PREV
}
}
}
```

used like `transfer_states 123 321`

### Useful scripted effects\[[edit](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Effect&veaction=edit&section=65 "Edit section: Useful scripted effects") | [edit source](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Effect&action=edit&section=65 "Edit section: Useful scripted effects")\]

These scripted effects are defined in base game and might be useful to keep in the mod to cut down on the amount of code. As scripted effects, all of these use a boolean value as argument.
